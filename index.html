        Here I write a bunch of stuffs. The reason I am doing so is simply
        because I need some crud to fillout the web page with. I am fuly aware
        that it is a waste of time, but care, I do not. Writing is fun you see,
        and I will keep on doing it untill I can no longer. I should actually
        probabely write more. Creative writing, documantation, technical
        writing, programming. Writing is good, it is the cornerstone of human
        creativity and sharing culture.
