My name is Markus Palm, or Louise Palm, or just Palm based on how you know me. Most people call me Palm.

I'm a 30 year old nerd, I've been a hobby programmer for about half my life at this point.
Never dabbled in web development tho, this is most interesting.
Most of my latest experience with programming is C# through using Unity, making random stuffs.
Right now I'm working on a shitty adventure game! I got it all shared and available on [Github][repo], and a playable web version can be found over at [itch.io][game].

I'm a massive My Little Pony fan. Got suckered right into that about 5 years ago. Its silly, cute and fun.

Let me see if I can get a picture linked with some cute ponies to end this post with!
